			We're undergraduate students at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo - Brasil

		1min gecid
			gecid means group of critical experiences in digital infrastructures and it's composed of reserchers from different fields of knowledge: visual arts, music, architecture, engineering and computer science.
			We're based at the Inovation Center of Sao Paulo University and our work is made of a set of experiences which aim to think and problematize our contemporary digital infrastructures.
			Our researches are thought in the context in which we are inserted: Global South, Latin America and Brazil
			Our group at the same time aims to engage the academic world writing articles and academic journals and also the general public with artistic projects and efforts to democratize and demistify AI knowledge.

		5min art-decoder+proposta
			The motivation for this workshop is to think criticaly about the emmergence of AI services that walk side by side with us everyday. We are surrounded by these systems that are present in translation services (google), product and media recommendation, from youtube to instagram; object and face detection, heavily used by facebook. As one of our goals is to demistify the AI world we want to highlight that these systems are for from being perfect and their results may present some ideological bias. This bias may be associated to the dataset which can be unbalanced, and also can carry the world view of the person who made the data.
(**show example**)
			Besides, these computer vision systems may present unexpected results, that people who designed these systems would call errors, however sometimes these errors show a different perspective of the image that can turn out to be very poetic.
(**show example**)
			
			Art Decoder is a system made by some reserchers from our group to produce those compile those results in a way that we can view the perspective of different computer vision services. Each of them produce their own set of results which can range from tagging an image to classifying if an image has adult or racy content
			In this workshop we are going to work with Art Decoder. We prepared 4 different collections with works of art that are on display in MACBA. Those works of art have been read by some of those AIs, such as Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Recognition, ClarifAI, Microsoft Azure and Densecap.
			Each of these produce different results and our goal is to surf in the platform to find the results that you interpret as problematic and also those errors/glitches that you think that can be interpreted as poetic results.
			
			The reason we chose to use works of contemporary art is because these systems are not trained to function with all sorts of art and these works have a great variety of shapes, materials, colors and so on. This property can amplify these unexpected results.

		3min dinamica
			We're going to divide into 4 groups each of which will surf a different collection and we would like to ask you to select some images that fit those definitios we talked about and the chosen images will be included in our collective zine.
			We have these pieces of paper with the instructions we've just talked about, and a space to write down the gallery and image numbers together with the names of the two AIs you think should appear in the zine.
			If you have any doubts please ask us, we can help you navigate through Art Decoder

			We'll be analysing and selecting images for 25 minutes, then we would like to invite everyone to share what you have found out so that we can have a discussion about the results.

			We're concerned with privacy, so it's not mandatory to write your name and e-mail, however if you want to receive a copy of the zine by e-mail, and if you want your name to appear in the zine as a collaborator, please write them.
